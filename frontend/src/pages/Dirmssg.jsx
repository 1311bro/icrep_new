      <p>"The primary endeavor of this centre is to accentuate ethical conduct of research in all realms of knowledge especially scientific inquiries. 
        It attempts to create a group of students and scholars who would be responsible to find solutions to pressing ethical dilemmas in different facets of 
        scientific pursuits. Undoubtedly, different realms of knowledge cannot remain isolated primarily because challenges faced by todayâ€™s world cut across 
        traditional boundaries of disciplines Hence interdisciplinary studies and research is already a reality and this centre would inspire young minds towards 
        creative thinking so that new codes of conduct in various facets of research might be undertaken. Good science needs to exist for humanity to progress. 
        The centre would disseminate this basic knowledge through its academic activities by encouraging interdisciplinary studies so that ethical conduct of 
        research is undertaken. Science, technology and innovation must eventually drive our pursuit for a more equitable and sustainable development wherein 
        commitment between man and man and man and nature is recognized. Hence this centre would devise academic pursuits which will create a more socially 
        committed student community."</p>
